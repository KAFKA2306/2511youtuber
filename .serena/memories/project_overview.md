- Purpose: CLI-driven pipeline that assembles narrated Japanese finance videos from daily news by chaining modular workflow steps (news, Gemini scripting, Voicevox audio, subtitle formatting, FFmpeg rendering, optional metadata/publishing toggles).
- Tech stack: Python 3.11, uv/pyproject-managed deps, Gemini + Perplexity providers, Voicevox TTS, FFmpeg for media rendering; Aim dashboard, Discord bot, and Voicevox manager run via scripts.
- Structure: src/main.py entrypoint, workflow orchestration in src/workflow.py + src/core/, step logic inside src/steps/, providers under src/providers/, shared contracts in src/models.py, utilities (config/logging/secrets) in src/utils/, configs & prompts in config/, docs/ for operations, tests/ split by unit/integration/e2e with pytest markers, assets/ for fonts/art, scripts/ for automation.
